# Convolutional Neural Network with Regression

Language : Python 3, Keras

Package : TensorFlow 2, scikit-learn

This CNNR can modify every layers by yourself.

In this code, the regression is for a single class(or score ranged in 0 to 1), so if you want to change it to multi-class regression, you have to change last activation function as **softmax** and **the number of classes you're gonna regress to.**
